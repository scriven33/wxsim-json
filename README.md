This is a PHP file to turn the WXSIM Latest CSV File in to a JSON file. 

To use, you will need to put the json.php file in to the same directory as the the latest.csv file generated by WXSIM, on a web server.
You will then be able to view the JSON contents at http://host.example.com/json.php. 

Caution - it isn't pretty and the code probably isn't optimised, but it does the job.
